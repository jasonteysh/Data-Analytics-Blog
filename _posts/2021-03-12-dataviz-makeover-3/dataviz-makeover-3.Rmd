  This post presents a critical review, recommendations, and makeover of a visualization using data obtained from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, available via [this link](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/)
  
  This post constitutes part of the assessment for credit towards the Singapore Management Univerisity module ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Application, AY2020/2021 Term 2. 
  
  Final redesigned visualization can be found on this link:

### Discussion on Likert Scale Visualization

### Discussion on Visualization of Uncertainty

### Makeover Concept


Taking in the points discussed above, a redesigned visualization could look like the following:

## Section C: Redesigned Visualization

Using Tableau, the redesigned visualization based on the discussion points and concept presented in Section B above is created as follows:

## Section D: Step-by-Step for Viz Makeover 

This section provides a step-by-step guide to recreate the redesgined visualization. 

### Part 1 - Data Preparation

**Step 1.1 - Importing Data** 

After downloading the Southeast Asian 2010-2020 dataset, open up Tableau Desktop then drag-and-drop the downloaded Excel file onto a new tableau main page.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step1.PNG">

We can leave most of the data as-is, since they are relatively clean. We proceed to open up a new Worksheet in Tableau. Once that is done, we will quickly realise that Tableau automatically classified many of the numerical variables as Measures. We will need to shift these to become Dimensions. click on the following Measures while holding down the Ctrl key:-

- Event Id No Cnty
- Geo Precision
- Inter1
- Inter2
- Interaction
- ISO
- Time Precision

These variables are shifted to Dimension as their numerical values are codes representative of something and their numbers do not have any ordinal or nominal value.

### Part 2 - Creating Geospatial Visualization

**Step 2.1 - Base Map** 

The very first step to creating a geospatial visualization is to create a base map. The dataset conveniently came along with Longitudinal and Latitudinal data to map out where each of the conflict event happened; Tableau on the other hand, made it even easier by automatically recognizing that these variables have geographical role and assigned them to their correct lat-long meaning based on their name. We now drag the Longitude to Columns, and Latitude to Rows.
