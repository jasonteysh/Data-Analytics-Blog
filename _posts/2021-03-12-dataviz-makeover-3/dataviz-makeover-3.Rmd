## Section D: Step-by-Step for Viz Makeover 

This section provides a step-by-step guide to recreate the redesgined visualization. 

### Part 1 - Data Preparation

**Step 1.1 - Importing Data** 

After downloading the Southeast Asian 2010-2020 dataset, open up Tableau Desktop then drag-and-drop the downloaded Excel file onto a new tableau main page.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step1.PNG">

We can leave most of the data as-is, since they are relatively clean. We proceed to open up a new Worksheet in Tableau. Once that is done, we will quickly realise that Tableau automatically classified many of the numerical variables as Measures. We will need to shift these to become Dimensions. click on the following Measures while holding down the Ctrl key:-

- Event Id No Cnty
- Geo Precision
- Inter1
- Inter2
- Interaction
- ISO
- Time Precision

These variables are shifted to Dimension as their numerical values are codes representative of something and their numbers do not have any ordinal or nominal value. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step3.PNG" style="width:30%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">


### Part 2 - Creating Interactive Geospatial Dot Density Plot with Proportional Symbols

**Step 2.1 - Base Map** 

The very first step to creating a geospatial visualization is to create a base map. The dataset conveniently came along with Longitudinal and Latitudinal data to map out where each of the conflict event happened; Tableau on the other hand, made it even easier by automatically recognizing that these variables have geographical role and assigned them to their correct lat-long meaning based on their name. We now drag the **Longitude** to Columns, and **Latitude** to Rows.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step1.PNG">

**Step 2.2 - Basic Dot Density Map** 

We create a basic dot density map by drag-and-dropping "**Event Id Cnty**"onto the Detail tab. As with any one-to-one dot density map, each of the resulting dot represents one count of the variable - in this case, a conflict event. We further enhance the map by introducing another variable - "**Event Type**" - onto the Color tab. This added dimension allows viewers to identify the type of event (e.g. Battle, Protest, Riot) associated with each event. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step2.PNG">

**Step 2.2 - Proportional Symbols** 

Knowing the type of events and their concentration in a particular geo-spatial location is informative - however, not all events are of equal concerns: while some of the dots denotes relatively "civilized" encounters (e.g. peaceful protests, arrests of key politicians without any casualties involved), some are way more violent (e.g. battles, explosions). In this aspect, the dataset provides an appropriate variable - the number of **Fatalities**. To show the relative impact of each event proxied by the number of people killed during the event, we drag-and-drop the measure Fatalities onto the Size tab - the size of each dot would then provide the relative destruction (in human-life terms) of each event: the bigger the circle, the more lives the event claimed (and hence more impactful), and the smaller the inverse, the lesser the impact. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step4.PNG">

We do note that the circles are still relatively similar in size, and they are all very close together such that we are unable to distinguish dots that are overlapping. We do two further changes to enhance the dots' appearance:

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step4a.PNG">

First we enlarge the circle by first clicking on the Size tab, then sliding the slider to the right.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step4b.PNG">

Next, we reduce the opacity by first clicking on the Color tab, then change the Opacity to 50%. 

**Step 2.3 - Interactivity - Filters**

***Country***

Notice that we have also included **Country** as a Filter (by drag-and-dropping the Country pill into the Filters tab) at this point, which will be useful later on (remember to click on the small triangle beside the blue Country pill in the Filter tab, then check "Show Filter" for the filter to appear on the right-hand pane). 

***Event Type***

We do the same to "**Event Type**". Then we change both of these filters into Single Value (Dropdown) list.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step5.PNG">

***Actors***

We also want to create a filter based on the interacting actors. To achieve this, we first have to create a few intermediate variables. First, we create a new string field called **Inter1_recoded** that spells out what each of the coded number in **Inter1** means

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step4a.PNG" style="width:60%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

We do likewise for **Inter2** to create **Inter2_recoded**.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step4b.PNG" style="width:60%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

Lastly, we string these two variables together to create variable **Actors** that tells us the pair of actors in each conflict 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Step4c.PNG" style="width:60%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

Similarly. we then drag-and-drop the Actors variable onto the Filter pane and change the type to Single Value (Dropdown). 


**Step 2.4 - Aesthetics** 

**Map Background**

We next work on the aesthetics of the viz. First, the map background. While the default background is alreayd using the Light style, the background can be further faded to enhance the contrast between the various dots and the landmasses. This can be done by first clicking on the Map option on the options bar at the top, then selecting "Map Layers..." from the drop-down list. At the washout option, change the percentage to 40%.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step8.PNG">

**Title**

Next, we double click on the title to change it to the following. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step11.PNG" style="width:80%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">


**Step 2.4 - Tooltip**

We want viewers to be able to extract more information when they hover their mouse over - so we add in a customized Tooltip that can provide them just that. 

First, we create a new field that forms proper phrases with the parties involved - "**Actors_in_phrase**".

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step10.PNG" style="width:70%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

When there are no second actor, the variable will just return that an event was conducted "by <Actor1>".

When the second actor is either civilians or protesters, it means someone had done something to these people, and hence, "by <Actor1> on <Actor2>" 

And finally, when there are two non-civilian non-protesters actors (e.g. State Forces and Rebel Groups), the events are conducted by these two actors jointly 

Once that is done, we drag-and-drop the relevant fields into the Tooltip tab - for this Tooltip, we will need the following variables:

- Actors_in_phrase
- Admin1
- Country
- Event Type
- Notes
- Sub Event Type

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step10c.PNG" style="width:30%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

And lastly, we double click on the Tooltip tab, retain the relevant variables, and edit the Tooltip as follows:

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step10b.PNG" style="width:70%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

We now have an informative geospatial dot density map of conflict events with proportional representation of the fatalities. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\final.PNG">


### Part 3 - Animating Changes on Geospatial Map 

While interactive and information, the geospatial map does not make good use of the rich temporal data that the dataset provides. To better visualize change, animation can be included to present a viz that shows the conflict event by time. 

This is relatively straight forward in Tableau: first, we drag-and-drop the **Event Date** variable onto the Pages tab

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step9.PNG">

Next, go to the Format tab on the tool bar, select "Animation" from the drop-down, then turn Workbook Default "On". Change the Duration to "0.50 seconds (Medium)" and Style to "Sequential" if not already done

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step9c.PNG">

### Part 4 - Visualizing Change using Slopegraph 

We next open up a new Worksheet to create the second portion of the overall viz visualizing change using the Slopegraph. 

**Step 4.1 - Data Preparation & Variable Creation**

As usual, before we dive straight into creating the viz, we will do some data wrangling and create some useful variables first. 

***Year*** 

By default, the **Year** variable is of numeric dimension type, we will first need to change it to the proper Date type.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step0.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***Aggregating Events***

Next, we create a variable that counts the number of events. Without any further specification to the formula, Tableau will include data entry for the count according to the filters applied.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step1.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***Aggregating Fatalities***

We also create another similar variable, this time round to sum up the fatalities

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step2.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***Selector***

We have two types of change that we can visualize - number of events and number of fatalities. We want to allow viewers to be able to toggle between these two variables to distill relevant insights. We do that by creating a Parameter. Parameters can be created by right-clicking the blank space under the Data tab on the left-most panel and selecting the "Create Parameters..." option. We call this Parameter **Conflict Event or Fatalities**, taking in String data type with the following list of values:

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step3.PNG" style="width:90%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

After that, we create a variable called **Selected** that takes in the option selected by the viewers via the parameter:

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step4.PNG" style="width:60%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***Delta & Direction***

We create a variable **Delta** that informs us on the change in the numbers (positive if increase, negative if decreased). 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step11a.PNG" style="width:60%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

We then use Delta to find out the direction of movement of the numbers of conflict event/fatalities between any two years by creating the following **Direction** variable

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step11c.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***First or Last***


Finally, we create a variable called **First or Last** - this variable will be useful in allow us to show a line on the Slopegraph for only the starting and ending year; where either one is missing, the data point will only appear as a dot.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step7.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">


**Step 4.2 - Creating Basic Slopegraph**

To create a basic Slopegraph, drag-and-drop the **Event Date** dimension to Columns, the **Selected** variable (that takes in user selection of either number of fatalities or events) into Rows, and **Country** into the Detail tab.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step5.PNG">

But wait... this looks like a normal line graph and not slope graph! Recall earlier we mentioned the need to include the **First or Last** variable, now is the time. We drag-and-drop it onto the Size tab.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step8a.PNG">

Next, we go to the right hand panel where we find the "AGG(First or Last)" pane; we right-click on the False legend, and select "Hide" 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step8b.PNG">

This way, we should see the lines taking shape, with only two columns, one for the starting year, and one the ending. With this, we would also want viewers to be able to change the start and end year.

**Step 4.3 - Year Filter**

And that brings us to the creation of a Year filter. 

We first drag-and-drop the Event Date variable onto the Filter pane. A pop-up will appear - we select "Years" from the option list

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step9a.PNG">

Followed by checking the "Use all" option under the General tab, then click Ok. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step9b.PNG" style="width:40%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

We notice that the Year pill under the Filter pane is a dimension (blue pill). We click on the small triangle at the right-end of the blue pill, a list will pop up - we then select the date Year option as shown. The pill should turn green in color.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step9c.PNG" style="width:40%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

A window will pop up, and we select the "Range of dates" option, leaving all the other settings unchanged.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step9d.PNG">

Lastly, we click on the triangle at the right-end of the pill (this time green) again - check on "Show Filter" 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step9e.PNG">


**Step 4.4 - Aesthetic Enhancement** 

***Entire View***

First thing first, we change the view to "Entire View"

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step10.PNG">

***Chart Labels***

Next, we add in labels on both end of the line to enhance clarity. We click on the Label tab, then select "Line Ends" as the option (see below), unchecking the "Allow labels to overlap other marks" option, and make sure the option for both "Label start of line" and "Label end of line" are checked.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step12b.PNG">

We also want to edit the label to let the country and numbers be in one line

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step12c.PNG">

***Direction***

We make use of colors to make the direction of change more obvious. Drag-and-drop the **Direction** variable into the Color tab

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step12d.PNG">

Double-click on the AGG(Direction) legend pane to edit the color - we want blue to denote decrease (since decrease in conflict event or fatality is good), while red to denote increase in the unfortunate numbers. We select the Blue-Red-Brown palette, then make the appropriate changes. "Not Applicable" in this case denotes countries where either the start or the end year data is not found (and hence we cannot visualize the change between the two years)

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step12e.PNG">

***Title Labels***

We hide the field labels for columns by right clicking the lable ("Event Date"), then selecting the "Hide Field Labels for Columns" option

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step13a.PNG">

Next, we edit the y-axis title by right-clicking on the axis title, then selecting "Edit Axis", the screen below will pop up - amend the title to "Total Number" while keeping the other settings unchanged

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step13b.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

***Title***

Next, we change the title to something more accurate by double-clicking on the viz title, and changing it to the following:

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step13c.PNG" style="width:80%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

**Step 4.5 - Tooltip** 

And finally, we include Tooltip by clicking on the Tooltip tab and making the changes as follows (all variables needed should already be within the original Tooltip):

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step15.PNG" style="width:80%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

We now have the final Slopegraph! 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\final.PNG">

### Part 5 - Interactive Dashboard

**Step 5.1 - Linking Filters**

Before we even create the Dashboard, we would need to link up the various filters across the two different sheets in order for the filters to apply across viz from from sheets. 

At the Temporal Slopegraph sheet, click on the small triangle on the top-right corner of the Year filter pane. Select the option "Apply to Worksheets", then choose "Selected Worksheets..."

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step14a.PNG">

Next, check the other worksheet (in this case, "Geospatial"), in order for this filter to also apply to the geospatial dot density map viz. 

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Temporal\Step14.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

Similarly, we return to the Geospatial Worksheet and do the same to the **Actors**, **Country**, and **Event Type** filters.

<img src="C:\ISSS608 Visualization Analytics\DataViz Makeover\Data Analytics Blog\_posts\2021-03-12-dataviz-makeover-3\Media\Geospatial\Step6.PNG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

**Step 5.2 - Creating Dashboard**

Now we commence with the creation of Dashboard by first clicking on the "New Dashboard" button at the borron of the viz (beside the Worksheet tabs).
