A total of 10 clarity issues and 8 aesthetic issues were identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nTitle (of 100% Bar Chart)\r\nTitle asked a question with no obvious answer provided from the visualization - at a first glance, this title created more questions than answer - after looking at the viz, we are still unclear which country is more “pro-vaccine”. This is partly due to issue S/n 2 and S/n 3 discussed below.\r\n2\r\nSort Order (for 100% Bar Chart)\r\nThe main drawback of the visualization is the lack of meaningful sort (which is presented in an alphabetical order). In this case, viewers will need to visually seek out the country with the longest blue bar in order to make meaningful deduction (assuming only the blue bars are of interest to the viz-maker - which leads to the next issue)\r\n3\r\nMissing Survey Question\r\nThis is another major flaw of the visualization - there is no way of knowing what was the question that respondents strongly agree or disagree to even if we know what each color is referring to.\r\n4\r\nIncomplete Information on Data Representation\r\nThe legend does not give any description for the values 2 (orange), 3 (red), and 4 (light blue). It does not clearly reflect that the segments are ordinal (i.e. in order of any significance) and hence confusion on the interpretation of the viz.\r\n5\r\nMissing Definition for Survey Responses\r\nRelatedly, while the titular question asked which country is more pro-vaccination, there is no clear indication of which color segment constitutes the “pro-vaccine” population (i.e. should we count the orange bar? What about the red bar?).\r\n6\r\nAmbiguous Unit of Measure\r\n“% of Total Record” does not sufficiently explain what the base of the “%” is, and what constitutes the “Total Record” (which seems to be a variable name)\r\n7\r\nMeaningless Headers in Legend\r\nSimilar to Issue 4 above, “Vac 1” does not explain what question the response was for and is as meaningless as putting any random symbol. In fact, it creates even more confusion (especially since the actual survey question is no where in sight) - is the question asking whether respondents are willing to take only one (and not two) vaccine shots? Or perhaps, take it only after 1 year?\r\n8\r\nRedundancy of the Bar Chart on the Right\r\nAfter diving deeper into the viz, it not difficult to realize that the right-hand viz is a repetition of the blue bars in the left-hand viz (except it is sorted by length of the blue bar)\r\n9\r\nMisleading Viz without Uncertainty\r\nAs a survey response, it is unclear how certain the visualizer is in the data (in the sense of statistical certainty) - it would be more helpful if the viz is presented with the error margins for various confidence interval presented\r\n10\r\nMissing Sample Size Info\r\nIn similar vein to the issue above, It is not clear if all the country has equal number of respondents, which could present a biased viz using percentage information.\r\nAesthetic\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nNo Clear Color Transition\r\nColor chosen for the ordinal scale is arbitrary and does not show any reflect any meaningful representation of the response scale, nor do they aid in answering the titular question. In fact there is even a repetition of blue (dark for 1, light for 4) for responses that are very different\r\n2\r\nPlacement of Legend\r\nWhile the legend is applicable for both charts, it is more applicable for the visualization on the right. However, the placement of it on the right panel of the viz requires viewers to glaze across the right-hand viz to extract information (however limited it is) from the land-hand viz to the legend\r\n3\r\nInconsistent Order\r\nWhile both the left- and right-hand viz are sending similar message, the fact that they are sorted differently makes them aesthetically irritable (and no less confusing - as covered in S/n 2 in Clarity section above)\r\n4\r\nChoice of Viz\r\nUsing bar chart to depict percentage of population that strongly agree to vaccination takes up unnecessary data ink (in addition to being inefficient in depicting accurate info with uncertainty - as discussed in S/n 9 in Clarity section)\r\n5\r\nSloppy text\r\nUsing ‘%’ instead of spelling percentage out makes the viz unprofessional and reeks of sloppiness\r\n6\r\nImproper Spelling of Proper Noun\r\nThe issue above is exacerbated by the fact that country names are spelled without capitalizing the initial letter, as with the norm for proper nouns\r\n7\r\nTypo Error\r\nFurthermore, spelling mistakes (“vacinne”) were spotted in the most obvious location - the title\r\n8\r\nInconsistent Decimal Placing\r\nThe two visualizations also bore differing decimal points for the common X-axis\r\nSection B: Suggested Improvement\r\nThis section provides some suggested improvements that could be implemented to resolve issues discussed in Section A.\r\nClarity\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\n1\r\nTitle\r\nEnsure that a proper title that is reflective of the viz is given, If the title is providing answer to a question, the answer should be easily identified / obvious from the viz. Proper subtitle could also be given to provide more information on the viz (e.g. the original survey question that was asked, the year in which the survey was conducted etc.)\r\n2\r\nSort Order\r\nWhen there is an ordinal variable of interest (in this case, responses that are pro-vaccination) involved in the visualization, proper sorting of the variable of interest should be done in ascending or decscending order for ease of reference, especially in such cases where the categories does not have inherent rank/order (i.e. countries, as opposed to, say, age groups, which have inherent order).\r\n3\r\nMissing Survey Question\r\nWhile the survey has solicited responses on a multitude of vaccination-related questions, the viz appears to only present response to one particular question (and without even providing the question in the viz). The existing viz can be improved by firstly presenting the questions to which the responses are visualized, and secondly to allow interactive toggling of different questions to see how various countries responded differently for the different questions\r\n4\r\nIncomplete Information on Data Representation\r\nWhile the codebook itself does not specify the corresponding meaning for each of the value, common norm for similar 5-class Likert Scale survey response could be adopted (i.e. Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree). At the very least, the viz should be consistent - if 2,3, and 4 are presented without qualitative description, the description for 1 and 5 should be removed as well.\r\n5\r\nMissing Definition for Survey Response\r\nIf there is no proper definition to define who are exactly “pro-vaccination”, viz-maker should make an effort to provide a definition to reduce ambiguity in the viz presented (one may argue that only those who strongly agree to the question that they will vaccinate themselves as “pro” vaccination, while others may argue that even those who sits on the fence, i.e. neutral, are not “anti” and hence pro-vaccination). As much as possible, the title should be non-controversial and presents matter-of-facts to prevent confusion.\r\n6\r\nAmbiguous Unit of Measure\r\nTo provide clarity on the data being presented, axes should clearly indicate the unit of measure and explain/present the base for which the measure is measuring - not simply leaving the auto-generated axis header with variable names as it is\r\n7\r\nMeaningless Headers in Legend\r\nHeader, if any, should be clear, and enhance the comprehension for the legend, not confusion. Otherwise, it might be better to do without any header\r\n8\r\nRedundancy of the Bar Chart on the Right\r\nAn additional chart should provide additional information and not just repeat what is already interpretable from another chart, even if it is to highlight certain aspect of the other chart (which could be achieved with other means). At the very least, the second viz should have a synchronised axis with the first if they are presenting on similar data to prevent confusion.\r\n9\r\nMisleading Viz without Uncertainty\r\nA better improved version would be to plot an uncertainty visualization using dots-and-lines, with the dot representing proportion for the sub-population (in this case country), and lines (“wings”) extending out to reflect the uncertainty involved. This would give a more accurate depiction of the data presented without misleading with missing uncertainty information.\r\n10\r\nMissing Sample Size Info\r\nAdditional information could be included to provide a clearer broad picture of the data used (e.g. sample size, confidence interval for different confidence level) to give viewer a more informative and accurate understading of the data\r\n11\r\nAdditional Enhancement\r\nBeyond the improvements to be made in view of the issues discussed, the dataset provided also included various other questions that could be of relevance to answering the question of “which country is most pro-vaccine”, as well as having the potential to distill further insights from a demographical breakdown using an interactive visualization. Hence, relevant response results as well as socio-economic data could be incorporated as parameters or filters to allow deeper understanding of the data to better meet the objective of the viz.\r\nAesthetic\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\n1\r\nNo Clear Color Transition\r\nColor chosen for the ordinal scale should be reflective of the response (e.g. transit from darker/brigter to lighter/muted shades of the same color for differing degrees of response such as between Strongly Agree and Agree; and have contrasting color for positive and negative responses such as red for disagree and blue for agree in this case)\r\n2\r\nPlacement of Legend\r\nLegend should be positioned for ease of reference\r\n3\r\nInconsistent Order\r\nSorting conventions (e.g. for non-ordered/ranked categories, don’t have to keep to existing order, e,g, alphabetical, if the variable of interest has an ascending/descending order) should be followed for ease of reference and prevent aesthetically unpleasing jagged viz in the different colored bars\r\n4\r\nChoice of Viz\r\ndata ink should be optimised (while not losing clarity) as much as possible with good choice of visualization\r\n5\r\nSloppy text\r\nProper spelling of fucntions, names, and variabales should be used to present viz professionally\r\n6\r\nImproper Spelling of Proper Noun\r\nEfforts could be made to edit presentation and adopt proper English conventions for spelling\r\n7\r\nTypo Error\r\nTypo error should be avoided and vetting should be done before publishing\r\n8\r\nInconsistent Decimal Placing\r\nDecimal Placing should be consistent especially if similar data drawing from the same variable is being used\r\nDiscussion on Likert Scale Visualization\r\nThe visualization on the left is essentially a basic Likert Scale visualization using a 100% Stacked Bar. In what is now a classic debate in the data visualization realm, Stephen Few, in his 2016 blogpost, countered Cole Nussbaumer Knafic’s preference for a 100% Stacked Bars, and proposed alternative visualizations to achieve different objectives. He argued that \"variations on the design of 100% stacked bar graphs usually work better). For one, he recommended what is now known at Diverging Stacked Bars (negative values running left from zero and positive values running right from zero) with separate neutral bars. He argued that this allowed difference between positive and negative results to stand out more. For situations where neutral results are more appropriate to be incorporated in the same viz, he recommended for the results to run down the middle.\r\nThe proposals, especially the latter with neutral running down the middle, was met with resistance from Nussbaumer, expectantly. She argued that the neutral bars in the middle creates the illusion where results with long neutrals appear to be more positive than they really are, courtesy of a long neutral that pushes bars further in the positive and negative regions.\r\nNussbaumer was not the only one who disagreed. Lisa C. Rost & Gregor Aisch discussed two minor and one major shortcomings of the diverging stacked bars in their 2018 blogpost, in favour of the 100% stacked bar. Rost and Aisch argued based on the following three premises:\r\nThe total agree & disagree shares are more important than the individual values of ‘strongly agree’ and ’agree\r\nOpinions are more important than non-opinions (“people who are undecided are kind of boring”)\r\nIncluding neutral percentages in the final chart is important (“‘Don’t know’ is data”)\r\nBased on these premises, the authors argued that the divergent bar charts (1) loses intuitive understanding that parts within the stacked bars are shares, (2) is a waste of space, and (3) is hard to compare the length to either side of the middle line (and this is worse in the neutral-in-the-middle version). The authors also summarized the various viz options for Likert Scale data:\r\n\r\nThis was subsequently met with a response from Daniel Zvinca, who presented a solution with stronger views in the middle, advocating for a “butterfly-like” design, showing the most antagonist (i.e. strongest) values in the center. Daniel argued that this allows viewer to focus on what is most important (be it for policymakers or business owners to focus on who most agree/disagree with their product/service). He also argues that this solution addresses the weaknesses highlighted by Rost & Aisch.\r\nLastly, Daniel provided options for the treatment of the neutral values - depending on the target question in mind for the visualization to address, neutral bars can be split equally into two ends of the chart or to either end.\r\nBased on the series of discussion/debate above, it is clear that 100% stacked bars and diverging stacked bars each have their pros and cons. For the purpose of this dataviz makeover, where the objective is to present survey responses to reflect proportion of population that are supportive of the use of vaccine versus those who are not. In this simplified problem statement (i.e. a dichotomy between pro and non-pro vacccine population), the Diverging Stacked Bar is preferred. Daniel’s version of placing stronger opinions in the middle provides a clearer distinction between two opposing camps of opinion - exactly apt for this viz’s objective.\r\nIn the treatment of neutrals, the author of this viz makeover agrees strongly with the premises laid out by Rost and Aisch, including the fact that neutrals will need to be included (though they are boring). This is especially important when we move on the discussion next on biasness and uncertainty. Of course, considerations were also made on the space constraints to incorporate two charts in one viz (more on that in next section), and neutrals, bring no more special than other non-pro response in this case, does not warrant a separate column on its own for special attention. In line with the principle to display stronger views in the middle, neutrals (being the least “strong”) will be pushed to the sides. In consideration of the dichotomy nature, though, it would be more appropriate for the neutrals in this viz to be on the negative end of the chart (i.e. the non-“pro” end) - ultimately, sitting on the fence for an issue definitely does not qualify one as being “pro” towards the issue.\r\nA visualised concept of the proposed viz is presented by Daniel in his post and presented below:\r\n\r\nReferencing the summary table drawn up by Rost & Aisch, this version provides the advantages that a Stacked Bar Chart offers, preserves the 100% proportionality (i.e. all bars are of equal length summing to 100%), all while creating the contrast in the middle for visual distinction that is not present in the Stacked Bar Chart. Steve Wexler presents a step-by-step guide for the creation of a Diverging Stacked Bar, for which this viz references.\r\nDiscussion on Visualization of Uncertainty\r\nBecause of errors from random sampling, it is difficult to determine the exact value of the population mean from which the sample is drawn from using only information from the sample. However, it is possible to construct a set of values that contains the true mean with certain prespecified probability - this is referred to as the confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval, in lay terms, provides a range for which we are confident the true mean would fall within 95 times if we were to repeat the sampling 100 times.\r\nWhen discussing survey response, it is critical to present the results with the uncertainty that comes along with sampling, lest we mislead viewers into thinking the sample results are definitive in representing the population at-large, and conclude more than the data allows. Visualization of uncertainty is also critical when we have different sample sizes across the categories we are comparing, and especially so for sub-categories where the sample sizes are small (and hence uncertainty are correspondingly huge) - without visualizing the uncertainty, viewers will be misled into concluding something based on only a small sample.\r\nNicole Torres discussed the difficulty in visualizing this uncertainty in a 2016 article - attributing the difficulty in the abstract nature of the uncertainty (Torres went on to also discuss the issue of interpretation - e.g. given a 90% chance of an event happening, even if it does not happen, it does not mean the prediction/viz is wrong; the unlikely just happened. But this is outside the scope of this blog post). Claus O. Wilke discussed this problem on the visualization of uncertainty in Chapter 16 of his book - Fundamentals of Data Visualization. In visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates (as is the case we want to make in this viz, for the proportion of respondents who are pro-vaccination - or whichever question is asked), Wilke presented several options, each with an identified strengths and weaknesses. Wilke explained that error bars with cap highlight the existence of different ranges corresponding to different confidence levels, but adds on visual noise.\r\n\r\nSteve Wexler, in another step-bystep guide in the visualization of error bars in Tableau, referencing Ben Jones’ book Communicating Data with Tableau. In this blogpost/guide, Wexler advocated for the dot-with-dual-error bars viz, while providing his comments to this eventual choice\r\n\r\nWexler echoed Milke’s concerns that a cap line (‘whiskers’ at the end) gets too much attention than the dot and error lines themselves. He also presented a ‘fingernail’ chart, which he confessed to be ugly; a gradient bar for the confidence interval, which are cool but distracting; as well as a Gnatt error bars, which are similarly stole the limelight from the main dot point estimate.\r\nWexler concurred with Sönning’s views in his paper that prominent elements should receive more attention and hence decided on the final dot-with-error-bars (without whiskers) that we see above. The author of this visualization agrees with the need to ensure salient figures are given the attention they require and to reduce distractions to viewers. Wexlex’s step-by-step guide, as well as the Tableau workbook enbeded within, were used for the visualization of the dot-with-error-bars viz for this post.\r\nMakeover Concept\r\nTaking in the points discussed above, a redesigned visualization could look like the following:\r\n\r\nAddressing Clarity Issue\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nWays in which proposed viz resolve issues identified\r\n1\r\nTitle\r\nThis new viz provides clear title of what the question is asking, as well as some of the key info in the subtitle\r\n2\r\nSort Order\r\nA much interpretable viz with the countries having positive responses immediately identified with both charts\r\n3\r\nMissing Survey Question\r\nSurvey questions is included in prominence\r\n4\r\nIncomplete Information on Data Representation\r\nClear information provided on what each color means with proper placement of response value\r\n5\r\nMissing Definition for Survey Response\r\n“Pro-vaccine” vs those who are not are clearly segregated into two sides of the “y-axis” to provide visual dichotomy to address the the objective of the viz - i.e. which country is more pro-vaccine.\r\n6\r\nAmbiguous Unit of Measure\r\nProper display on unit of measure to reduce ambiguity\r\n7\r\nMeaningless Headers in Legend\r\nSince the responses are intiutive when presented together with the survey question as the title, a header is redundant and removed\r\n8\r\nRedundancy of the Bar Chart on the Right\r\nViz on the right is revamped to showcase the uncertainty involved in presenting the “pro” vaccination response, and hence, a different dimension to the viz with additional information - it is no longer redundant\r\n9\r\nMisleading Viz without Uncertainty\r\nViz on the right has addressed this issue to enhance clarity and accuracy\r\n10\r\nMissing Sample Size Info\r\nSample size info is provided for viewers to make informed deduction on the proportion of pro-vaccinators, where longer uncertainty error bars gives raises the alert for viewer to be cautious, and the records number provides another point of reference to pick out any red-flags.\r\n11\r\nAdditional Enhancement\r\nEnhancement in the form of filters and parameters to narrow down into particular sub-population is also added - this makes use of the inherent strength of tableau - allow user-friendly dashboards for users to toggle and explore the dataset to its full potential. Lastly, the visualizations are also optimized to tailor to the objective in mind, as discussed in the sub-segment above.\r\nAddressing Aethetic Issue\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\n1\r\nNo Clear Color Transition\r\nProper color transition and contrasts are incorporated to emphasize the distinction between those who are “pro” and those who are not, as well as to provide greater focus on stronger opinions.\r\n2\r\nPlacement of Legend\r\nLegend is placed at position easy for reference\r\n3\r\nInconsistent Order\r\nBars are sorted to enhance clarity as well as in a visually-pleasant manner\r\n4\r\nChoice of Viz\r\ndata ink are optimized with the choice of viz that best presents the data while preserving (or even enhancing) clarity\r\n5\r\nEditorial Issues\r\nProper spelling of functions, names, and variables are used; English conventions adopted; typo vetted against; and consistency in formatting are in placed to ensure professionalism\r\nSection C: Redesigned Visualization\r\nUsing Tableau, the redesigned visualization based on the discussion points and concept presented in Section B above is created as follows:\r\n\r\nThe redesigned visualization can also be accessed via this link\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection D: Step-by-Step for Viz Makeover\r\nThis section provides a step-by-step guide to recreate the redesgined visualization.\r\nPart 1 - Data Preparation\r\nStep 1.1 - Download and Import Data\r\nFirst, download the data files used via this link to the Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub.\r\nAs the data files are separated by the various countries for which the surveys are conducted, with some being zipped up in zip folders, we will next need to unzip these files. For the ease of data retrieval later on, we will store all the country files to be used in one common folder.\r\n\r\nThereafter, open Tableau Prep Builder to prepare for the data wrangling process.\r\nStep 1.2 - Importing Mulitple CSV files\r\nDrag-and-Drop one of the country file to be used onto the home page of Tableau Prep Builder. Under the ‘Input’ panel, select ‘Muiltple Files’, click on ‘Wildcard union’, then search in the folder where all the country files to be used are stored. Click ‘Apply’\r\n\r\nStep 1.3 - Filtering Relevant Data\r\nOnce all the datasets are joined, uncheck all fields then check on the box of the following relevant fields to select them for retention:\r\nVac_1, vac2_1, vac2_2, vac2_3, vac2_6, vac_3\r\nendtime\r\ngender\r\nage\r\nemployment_status, employment_status_1 through employment_status_7\r\nhousehold_size, household_children\r\nFile paths\r\nOnce that has been applied, we next filter the data to focus on records from Year 2021: click on the ‘Filter Value’ tab, and input the following calculation, then click Apply and Save\r\n\r\nStep 1.4 - Data Issue: Pivoted Employment Fields\r\nThere are numerous data issue with the employment_status fields. Most obviously, Nordic countries Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland actually pivoted the employment_status field to form 7 different columns for each of the responses. The real problem, however, is that there are overlaps in positive responses to the 7 columns (i.e. they are not mutually exclusive - respondents could answer “Yes” to multiple employment status).\r\nTo resolve this issue, priority has to be devised to accord one prevailing status for rows with multiple Yes’s to the employment status. In this visualization, full-time employment will take precedence over any other status (i.e. if a respondent answers Yes to full-time employment, he/she will be recorded as having full-time employment under a recoded employment status column). Next piority, in order, will be for full-time student, then part-time employment (other status has no overlaps). The above logical recoding of the employment status field can be achieved by creating the following calculated field:\r\n\r\nStep 1.5 - Renaming Fields and Values\r\nNext, we rename the File Path variable to ‘Countries’, remove the ‘.csv’ at the end of each entry, then capitalize the country name for proper spelling of country names.\r\n\r\nFor the Household Size and Household Children fields we regroup all categories 8 and above as ‘8 or More’. ‘Don’t know’ and ‘Prefer not to say’ entries are recoded as null.\r\nStep 1.6 - Output Data\r\nFinally, include an Output node on the Prep Building flow\r\n\r\nOutput the cleaned data as a csv file back to the folder where the datasets were stored, with the following options:\r\n\r\nPart 2 - Creating Divergent Stacked Bar\r\nStep 2.1 - Importing Data & Assigning Variable Types\r\nFirst, open Tableau then import the merged and cleaned dataset by drag-and-dropping it onto the main page.\r\nTableau automatically assigns variables with integer values as Measures - this is not accurate for our survey response variables where 1 represents ‘Strongly Agree’ and 5 ‘Strongly Disagree’. Hence, we shift these vac_x variables from the Measures section to the Dimension section\r\n\r\nStep 2.2 - Creating Variables for Stacked Bar\r\nWe start by assigning 1 to all entry and call it ‘No. Record’ - this will come in handy when we calculate the survey entries. Go to the “Analysis” tab at the top of the page, click on “Create Calculated Field…”, then input the following name and formula:\r\n\r\nNext, we sum up the records count by creating the following new calculated field following the same steps as above:\r\n\r\nWe will need a Parameter to toggle between the different questions we have included in the viz, soliciting user to select a question of interest. - Right click on an empty spot in the Data panel, select “Create Parameter…” from the list of options. - Rename the Parameter to “Select Question” - Data type as String - Check on “List” for “Allowable values” - Input the corresponding variable name for the different vaccination-related survey question that we have chosen to retain, then key in their corresponding full question under “Display As”.\r\n\r\nThe Parameter will then need to be “activated” to trigger response to the viz: create a new calculated field (“Question Selected”) using the CASE function as below - when a parameter is selected, the corresponding “vac_x” variable will be called into view:\r\n\r\nNext, we want to survey responses which are more than 2 (neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) to bear a weight of 1 for a variable called ‘Count Negative’ - this will allow these (non-“pro”) responses to start from left of the middle origin y-axis divider later.\r\n\r\nSum up this variable across the table in the variable ‘Total Count Negative’\r\n\r\nNext, we need the Percentage of responses that selected each response foe the selected question (Strongly Agree, Agree, etc.), out of the total record\r\n\r\nAnd because the divergent bars are ultimately a Gantt chart, we will need a variable to tell the individual response value where to start - by dividing the Total Count Negative by the sum of Total Count (with a negative in front), we will be able to identify where the values bigger than 2 (i.e. neutral, disagree, strongly disagree) will start from the left of the y-axis (note the negative sign at the beginning of the formula below for the variable Gantt Start).\r\n\r\nThe final variable to create for the basic stacked bars is a little more tricky - we need a variable to tell us how long the bar for each response should be when stacked together. We first find where the bar starts, then add the percentage of the next row, skipping null values (note: up to this step, Tableau will compute this across table, later on we will specify for it to compute using each responded value, together with Gantt Start, Gantt Percent will then start where the previous response value ends, then add all entries with that response value together, then restart for each response value)\r\n\r\nStep 2.3 - Divergent Stacked Bar\r\nNow we put everything together. We drag-and-drop Countries to Rows, Gnatt Percent to Columns, change the chart type to Gnatt Bar, drop Question Selected to Colour and another one to Detail, and finally Percentage to Size\r\n\r\nThereafter, we go to the little triangle on the green Gnatt Percent pill, ‘Compute Using’ option, and select ‘Question Selected’. Do the same for the green Percentage pill under Size.\r\n\r\nUnder Colour, click on ‘Edit Colors…’, select dark blue for 1, light blue for 2, muted neutral color for 3, light pink for 4, and bright red for 5. Right-click on the Question Selected blue pill under colour, and select ‘Sort’. Under ‘Sort By’, choose Manual, and arrange then in 3>4>5>1>2 order (based on conclusion from Section B, we want to put the stronger views in the middle, with neutral at the end of the “non-pro” side)\r\n\r\nAnd there, a basic Divergent Stacked Bar is created! One last touch - to change the negative percentage on the left of Y-axis to positive. Right-click on the X-axis, select Format, under Scale, Numbers, choose ‘Custom’ and type ‘0%;0%’ as the format\r\n\r\nStep 2.4 - Sort Viz\r\nWe want to create a sorting variable (which will also be used in the following portion of our viz) to calculate percentage of respondents who provided positive response to the questions asked (i.e. either Strongly Agree or Agree). But first, we need to sum up all the positive responses with a new ‘Value’ field\r\n\r\nThen divide this value by the number of records to get the percentage of positive responses- “Pro Percent”\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we can go back to the blue Country pill under Rows, right-click and select ‘Sort’, select ‘Field’ under ‘Sort By’, Descending order, ‘Pro Percent’ under Field Name, and leave Custom as the Aggregation.\r\n\r\nPart 3 - Creating Bar Chart to Include as ToolTip\r\nStep 3.1 - Creating Bar Chart\r\nFirst, create a new Worksheet on Tableau. Before we do anything further, we create a new variable - ‘Ranked Response’ - to transform the 1-5 code into actual description of the response (e.g. Strongly Agree etc.)\r\n\r\nNext, at the new Worksheet, we drag-and-drop No. Record onto Columns, and Ranked Response onto Rows and Color box, then Percentage into Label box. Change the color of the viz using the ‘Pick Screen Color’ option to ensure consistency on the color bar with the main viz. Manually sort the order of the Y-axis to start from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree.\r\nNote: When presented as a bar char instead of a diverging stacked bar, it would be more intuitive to transit from strongly positive response to strongly negative ones, since we are not trying to depict a dichotomy/contrast here, but merely to provide additional information of viewers to make visual comparison of the country-wide response. Hence this order instead of aligning with the main viz’s order\r\n\r\nStep 3.2 - ToopTip linking sheets\r\nWe head back to the Divergent Stacked Bar sheet. We create one variable Percentage Response that multiplies 100 to the variable Percentage (this will make the ToolTip information more easily interpretable as a percentage of response). Include this new variable, together with Ranked Response into ToolTop box, and input the following into ToolTip\r\n\r\nHowever, we notice that the Ranked Response does not change color when we hover over each of the different ranked responses. Hence, to improve it even further, we create another 5 separate variable to create to color changing effect\r\n\r\nThe above uses Strongly Agree as an example, the process is repeated to create 4 other variables for the four other response value. Next, put all 5 newly created variable into ToolTip\r\n\r\nFinally, edit the ToolTip as follows:\r\n\r\nAnd the complete Stacked Bar Chart with informative summary and ToolTip showing overall survey response from the country is created!\r\n\r\nPart 4 - Visualizing Uncertainty\r\nStep 4.1 - Creating Variables Required\r\nWe have created two important variables earlier (Value and Pro Percent). Next, we will need a few more variables that measure uncertainty. Starting with the Standard Error\r\n\r\nZ-scores \r\nError Margins \r\n95% Bounds \r\n99% Bounds \r\nConfidence Intervals \r\nA Parameter to allow toggling between 95% and 99% CI, both, or none to be shown. Select ‘String’ as the Data type, List for Allowable values, and the values and displays as follows \r\nUpper and Lower Bounds for the two different confidence level \r\nAnd one final variable to display the absolute percentage point of uncertainty from the estimated proportion - the Confidence Interval, which will show 99% CI for all cases except when only 95% CI is chosen for the parameter. \r\nStep 4.2 - Creating Basic Uncertainty Viz\r\nFirst, drag-and-drop Countries onto Rows and Pro Percent onto Column\r\n\r\nNext, drag-and-drop Measure Values onto Columns; a list of variables will appear on the Measure Value panel to the left of the viz, remove all except the four upper/lower bounds for 95%/99% CI (as shown below). On the Measure Value green pill under Columns, right-click and select Dual Axis,\r\n\r\nOn the Measure Values tab under the Marks panel, select Line as the chart type, then drag-and-drop the blue Measure Names pill from Detail to Path. Click on Color to change it to a grey color to distinguish from the dotted mean, and reduce the size of the lines.\r\n\r\nRight-click on the top Axis to select Synchronize Axis, then uncheck Show Header to turn it off.\r\n\r\nSort the Y-axis by descending Pro Percent (as with earlier Divergent Stacked Bar viz to synchronize)\r\n\r\nOn the AGG(Pro Percent) tab under the Marks panel, drag-and-drop Pro Percent to Label; edit the labels to a smaller font (6pt) and ensure the format is Percentage (no decimal point). Formating can be done by right-clicking on the green Pro Percent pill under Label and selecting “format”. Similarly, X-axis should also be in Percentage format, and formating can be done by right-clicking and selecting ‘format’ as well (Under the Axis pane, go to ‘Scale’ segment, under ‘Numbers’, select ‘Percentage’). Right click on the X-axis and select ‘Move marks to front’ if not already at the front.\r\n\r\nSelect Entire View on the view option. Drag-and-drop both the ‘CI %-pt (+/-)’ and ‘No. Record’ variable onto Rows, then click on both the pills to change them from Continuous to Discrete (see below). Format the ‘CI %-pt (+/-)’ rows to retain 4 decimal points.\r\n\r\nNext, we allow the error bars to change according to the CI we have selected. First, drag-and-drop Measure Names into both Color and Size.\r\n\r\nWe then adjust the color of the bar to let 95% CIs (which are shorter) be of a darker grey, and 99% CIs be of a lighter grey - Double click on the color palette on the right under the header “Measure Names” then select the desired color (using the Seattle Grays palette makes life easier - just choose two from the 50 shades of gray…)\r\n\r\nNext, edit the sizes of the data information (by right-clicking the relevant areas and selecting ‘format’ to change the sizes, generally to size 7), reduce data ink (row dividers were removed to reduce data ink, this can be achieved by right clicking the via area, selecting ‘format’, under the Border tab, under Rows, select None for Pane), and change the axis title (see below) to “Percentage of respondents who answered Agree or Strongly Agree (%)”. And there we have our basic uncertainty viz\r\n\r\nStep 4.3 - ToolTip\r\nWe include a ToolTip to summarize the data points when hovered over. Before that, we create an extra variable showing the country’s mean percentage who responded positively to the selected question - “Country Pro Percent” - this will come in useful when we add on filters to allow toggling into sub-populations (see next step). With this Country Pro Percent, we would then be able to compare the sub-population’s positive response rate vis-a-vis the country’s average.\r\n\r\nFinally, we add on the ToolTip by clicking on the ToolTip box, where an editing box will pop up, and input as shown below\r\n\r\nStep 4.4 - Filters\r\nBefore we put everything together, let’s create one more filter - Age Group - by creating a new calculated field as follows.\r\n\r\nWe then drag-and-drop Gender, Age Group, Employment Status, Household Size, and Household Children onto the Filter panel, show all the filters. To optimize space, we will change Gender to single value drop-down, while the rest of the filters to multiple-values drop-down. Find the two Parameters on the Parameters panel on the bottom-left, and show both the Select Question and CI parameters as well.\r\n\r\nFor each of the filter, we click on the small triangle beside them, go to ‘Apply to Worksheet’, select ‘Selected Worksheet’ and check the box beside ‘Divergent Stacked Bar’ sheet. \r\nAnd there we have it, the final Visualization for Uncertainty with informative ToolTip. While the lines for the standard error margins are small in this version, it will be more obvious when we explore sub-population of each country by filtering down the dataset, which will lead to smaller number of records being available.\r\n\r\nPart 5 - Interactive Dashboard\r\nStep 5.1 - Basic Dashboard\r\nPutting them altogether is easy: first, drag-and-drop both the Worksheets onto an empty Dashboard: Diverging Stacked Bars worksheet first, then the Uncertainty sheet to the right, the parameters/filters will be automatically attached.\r\n\r\nNext, reconfigure the parameters and filters to go to the top of the page by shifting them around. Next, add in a Text Tiled object on top of the parameters and filters to input the title and subtitle. Lastly, change the Size to ‘Automatic’\r\n\r\nStep 5.2 - Final Dashboard with Action\r\nFinal step for this visualization is to add Actions: go to the Dashboard tab on the top, click on ‘Actions…’. Click on Add Action, then Highlight, and connect both sheets on the Dashboard with both sheets, running action on select.\r\n\r\nAnd there we have it - the final dashboard!\r\n\r\nStep 5.3 - Upload\r\nAnd once all is done, we upload the viz onto Tableau Public\r\n\r\nThis Visualization is made available on Tableau Public via this link\r\nSection E: Observations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A total of 8 clarity issues and 5 aesthetic issues (as shown below) were identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Critique on Original Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClarity\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nTitle\r\nThe purpose and objective of the original visualization was not conveyed well in the title of the chart. It misleads people into thinking that the graph shows absolute number of labour force by age when it is in fact showing the share of each age group within the work force.\r\n2\r\nSubtitle\r\nSubtitle that says “Per Cent” does not elaborate on what this per cent is referring to, nor explain which figure is the percentage derived from what base. Together with the title, it confuses viewers on the data being presented.\r\n3\r\nAxis Label\r\nMissing explanation for the “June 2009” and “June 2019” row data – without reading the paragraph before, there is no easy way to figure out that these numbers refer to share of workers in each age group within the labour force.\r\n4\r\nY-Axis\r\nThe graphs are literally floating with no Y-axis and its corresponding values (much less any gridlines) to anchor the actual value corresponding to each age group – this is as good as drawing random lines and is a critical flaw of the original viz. There is no easy way to know if the lines are corresponding to the correct Y-value even if we are provided with the data.\r\n5\r\nChoice of Viz Type\r\nSince the data is segregated by discrete age bins, line graph – which are more suitable for continuous x-variables, should be avoided to prevent giving false impression that the data is continuous within the bin (e.g. a kink for the 45-49 age, it leaves room for misinterpretation that a downtrend from 45 years old changed to an uptrend at 47 years old). This is especially confusing as there are no softgrid guiding where the bins cut-off\r\n6\r\nComparison Across Year\r\nSince the objective of the visualization is to explain that there are more older workers in the labour force, the choice of two line graphs is inefficient as it requires viewers to do a mental comparison of the higher line to derive the changes over time. Bearing the objective in mind, the difference between the two years could have been calculated and directly presented instead.\r\n7\r\nLead-in Paragraph\r\nLead-in paragraph is not supported by the visualization, in fact, it creates more confusion. While the age bins are split into 5-year bands (e.g. 15-19, with the only exception being those above 70), the paragraphs discuss the share of labour force by bigger bins, lumping together those aged 55 and over, as well as the 25-54 groups. This creates confusion as the figures quotes – “from 16% in 2009 to 25% in 2019” and “declined from 75% to 67%” - are all not interpretable from the visualization. The need for mental sums to add up the percentages across a few data points presented in the table is unintuitive and user-unfriendly. In terms of comparison between the years, author could have also enhance the readability by deriving the change in percentage points across the two years.\r\n8\r\nChoice of Data\r\nAs a general comment to the overall choice of data for the discussion, it might be clearer to talk about the change in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for each age group, rather than the composition of labour force – which could be more indicative of demographic change (e.g. ageing population) than shift in labour decisions.\r\nAesthetic\r\nS/N\r\nIssue\r\nComments\r\n9\r\nDefinition\r\nVisualization appears grainy and pixelated.\r\n10\r\nData Points and Labels\r\nNo softgrid nor data point to guide visual on which year corresponds to which point\r\n11\r\nFont Consistency\r\nInconsistent font colour for same data source – blue for the line is different from the blue words on chart, which is again different for the blue in the table below\r\n12\r\nChoice of Font Colours\r\nChoice of font colour does not contrast with background as well, hence not easy to read\r\n13\r\nAlignment\r\nInformation (Source and Note) at the bottom not aligned\r\nSection B: Suggested Improvement\r\nThis section provides some suggested improvements that could be implemented to resolve issues discussed in Section A.\r\nClarity\r\nS/N\r\nIssues\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\n1\r\nTitle\r\nThe title of the visualization could be modified to reflect the key message that the viz is trying to convey, and should correspond accurately to the main features of the viz\r\n2\r\nSubtitle\r\nSubtitle could be modified to provide key information to guide viewers in deciphering the viz (e.g. data and corresponding unit presented in the viz, year of data, location, and X-axis variable)\r\n3\r\nAxis Label\r\nProvide clear axis labels with accurate units of measure to prevent confusing readers\r\n4\r\nY-Axis\r\nInclusion of a Y-axis with suitable tick marks and guiding soft gridlines to enhance readability is important\r\n5\r\nChoice of Viz Type\r\nFor discrete variables (as in the bins of age range used), a bar chart would serve to provide better clarity to prevent misinterpretation\r\n6\r\nComparison Across Year\r\nTo achieve the objective to explain that there are proportionately more older workers in the labour force in 2019 than 2009, the difference between the two years could have been calculated and directly presented for a more effective visualization.\r\n7\r\nLead-in Paragraph\r\nLead-in paragraph should be supported by the viz, and any figures quoted by the paragraph should be available and obvious from the viz. Better interpretation and processing of the data (e.g. calculating and presenting the difference, if that is the objective) would also enhance clarity of the viz.\r\n8\r\nChoice of Data\r\nUsing data on the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for each age group could provide clearer comparison to achieve the objective of the viz\r\nAesthetic\r\nS/N\r\nIssues\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\n9\r\nDefinition\r\nEnsure visualization is not pixelated and has suitable definition\r\n10\r\nData Points and Labels\r\nProvide clear background gridline to enhance readability and data points/labels for viewer’s ease of reference\r\n11\r\nFont Consistency\r\nEnsure consistent font type and colour are used to represent distinct sets of data for consistency. Useful colors will also provide additional dimensions to enhance effectiveness of viz\r\n12\r\nChoice of Font Colours\r\nTo select contrasting colours for ease of reading\r\n13\r\nAlignment\r\nAs much as possible, to provide proper alignment within viz to reduce distraction caused by messiness\r\nMakeover Concept\r\nTaking in the points discussed above, a redesigned visualization could look like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Makeover Concept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection C: Redesigned Visualization\r\nUsing Tableau, the redesigned visualization based on the discussion points and concept presented in Section B above is created as follows:-\r\nThe redesigned visualization can also be accessed via this link\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Redeisgned Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection D: Step-by-Step for Viz Makeover\r\nThis section provides a step-by-step guide to recreate the redesgined visualization.\r\nStep 1 - Download and Import Data \r\nFirst, download the Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019 (Table 5) file via this link. Then, open Tableau Desktop to connect with the Excel file downloaded.\r\nStep 2 - Data Preparation \r\nCheck on the “Cleaned with Data Interpreter” box for Tableau to assist with data cleaning (if desire, may click on underlined “Review the results” to see data tables created). Select the “T5_T A5:Y18” to extract relevant data. Hide the first column and switch Connection on the top right to “Extract” (as we will be saving onto Tableau Public, which does not support Live connections). Save the Data Extract.\r\nStep 3 - Data Processing \r\nOnce the data are loaded, right-click on blank space under Data tab to select “Create Calculated Field”. Create a new field named “LFPR Change (%-pt)” with the formula “[2019]-[2009]” to create a field that tells us the change in percetage point of the LFPR for each age group from 2009 to 2019.\r\nStep 4 - Simple Viz Set-up \r\nTo set up the simple visualization, drag-and-drop the Age (Year) variable into the Column field, and the (aggregated) LFPR Change (%-pt) that we have just created into the Rows field, as well as Label. and Color marks. A simple visualization resembling the final viz is created.\r\nStep 5a - Editing Viz Color \r\nAs commented in Section B above, choosing appropriate color is important for a clear visualization - in this case, since we know there are positive and negative changes, we would want red to denote negative, and blue for positive to highlight the contrast. Double click on the Color legend tab, choose the Red-Blue Diverging palette, and check on the “Use Full Color Range” box.\r\nStep 5b - Adding Informative Title and Subtitle \r\nSimilarly, informative title that informs viewer of the viz’s main message, as well as accurate subtitle to provide additional information about the data is critical for a good Viz. Double click on the title to edit as shown above (selecting font size 22 for title and size 12 for subtitle, while keeping the default font type; color of the title may also be changed to provide contrast)\r\nStep 5c - Hiding Extra Elements \r\nWe then hide the field labels for columns by right-clicking on the label and selecting the hide option, and also hide the color bar card by clicking on the triangle at the top-right-hand corner of the card and selecting “Hide Card” (as shown).\r\nStep 5d - Formatting Labels \r\nNext, we right-click on the blank space on the viz and select “Format” to trigger the Format pane - on the Fields dropdown bar, select “SUM(LFPR Change (%-pt))”. Under Default, click on drop-down for Numbers, select “Number (Custom)” and change decimal places to “1” - this will change the percentage point changes to 1 decimal place. Under the same Default category, change the font size to 10, Similarly, switch the tab from “Pane” to “Axis” on the Format panel, and switch the default font to size 10 and Bold the font.\r\nStep 5e - Alias for X-Axis \r\nWe may notice that the X-axis label has large spacing between the two fringe of age range - return to the Data Source Sheet, right-click on the age column, select “Edit Aliases” and proceed to remove spacing for all age bins. For the last bin, change to “70&Older”.\r\nStep 5f - Remove Total \r\nLastly, since Total does not provide meaningful information here, we right-click on it and select Exclude to exclude this data.\r\nStep 6 - Basic Viz \r\nThat completes the set-up of the basic visualization. Remember to give the Worksheet a name and save the Tableau Workbook. Next, we will create a table that shows supporting data on LFRP for each age group in 2009 and 2019. This will provide more information for the visualization that will be useful when making observations.\r\nStep 7a - Supporting Tables Set-Up \r\nCreate a new Tableau Worksheet. Drag-and-drop Age (Years) into the Columns field, aggregated 2009 and 2019 data points into the Text Mark (as shown above), click on “Show Me” on the top-right hand corner of the viz and select the Data Table Viz. Next, click on the “Swap Rows and Columns” button on the panel above (or press Ctrl+W)\r\nStep 7b - Supporting Tables \r\nAs a final step for the supporting data table, exclude the Total column as shown above.\r\nStep 8a - Dashboard Setup \r\nTo incorporate various layout elements, create a new Dashboard on Tableau. Drag-and-drop the first Worksheet and then stack the Table worksheet below. Hide the Field Labels for Columns and the Axis label for the table by right-clicking on them individually and selecting the respective hide options. On the Dashboard panel on the left, resize the Dashboard to fit automatically be selecting the “Automatic” option under Size dropdown menu.\r\nStep 8b - Lead-In Paragraph \r\nAdd a Tiled Text object (from the bottom left corner as shown above) by drag-and-dropping a text object above the main Viz worksheet (i.e. top of the dashboard viz). Include the write-up as shown to explains the visualization and enhance the readability by highlighting some key/obvious findings corresponding to the viz. \r\nStep 8c - Axis Label for Supporting Table \r\nA good visualization should be clearly labeled - add in another text object to the left of the supporting data table at the bottom to inform viewer of the data being presented in the table, along with the unit of measure. Resize the text object and format it accordingly as shown.\r\nStep 8d - Appropriate Spacing \r\nAppropriate spacing to indent different section of a viz enhances its overall readability - include Blank objects at appropriate space and readjust elements to create well-aligned viz. \r\nStep 9a - Drawing Viewer’s Attention \r\nTo accentuate the key message found in the lead-in paragraph, it might even help to conscientiously draw viewer’s attention to a particular segment of the viz. To achieve this, we first create a floating Vertical object and place it above the bars showing where the Senior age groups are.\r\nStep 9b - Define Terms \r\nMaking use of the space in the viz, we enhance the clarity further by providing the definition of “Senior”. In this case, we anchor a Tiled Text object with the definition “Senior (Aged 60 & Older)” (which is in alignment with the Singapore’s Legal definition) onto the floating Vertical object by drag-and-dropping a Text object onto the floating object while holding down the Shift key.\r\nStep 9c - Cosmetic Changes \r\nWe then select the floating vertical object and under the triangle on the top right corner, select “Distribute Contents Evenly” and format the layout of the object as shown above (select colour, and change opacity to 5%)\r\nStep 9d - Cosmetic Changes II \r\nWe further add on another line to create a visual divide for “Seniors vs the Rest”. This is done by creating another vertical object but with a width of 1px - formatting is as shown above.\r\nStep 10 - Final Touch \r\nAnd finally, as we have floating objects which may be displaced when size of visualization changes, we revert the size of the visualization to a custom size fitting the resolution when the viz is created - in this case, 1,575px x 764px. This will also ensure the layout formatting will not have too drastic a change when the viz is uploaded onto Tableau Public.\r\nStep 11 - Upload \r\nAnd for the very last step, we save the visualization onto Tableau Public.\r\nFinal Product available on Tableau Public \r\nTada!\r\nSection E: Observations\r\nThe first key observation based on the redesigned visualization is that the three Senior age groups has the largest increase in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) from 2009 to 2019 (Note: according to senior-citizen-singapore.com, the Senior Citizen Act of Singapore defines a “Senior” as someone who has attained 60 years or higher). This is immediately brought to focus both by the segmented region with shaded background and captioned as “Seniors (Aged 60 & Older)”, as well as the title, which directly informs the reader of this most obvious and key takeaway from the visualization. The largest single age-group increase in LFPR belongs to those aged 65-69 year-old - increasing by 16.2 percentage point, from 2009’s 29.9% participation rate to 2019’s 46.1% participation rate. One of the reasons for this could be the increase in the legal re-employment age from 65 to 67 from 1 July 2017. This would mean that employers must offer re-employment to eligible employees up to age of 67 instead of 65 - that is, more elderly would be protected by law to be able to continue working past 65 years old if eligible. The next two age-groups with highest increase in LFPR are the 60-64 year-old and those 70 & older - as Singapore’s average life expectancy increased from 81.4 years in 2009 to 83.6 years in 2019, it will be a new norm for more seniors to be at work for an ageing Singapore. The reasons are twofold: (i) active working age will need to be lengthen to save up more for longer retirement years; and (ii) older workers may choose to stay in the workforce longer to keep them physically and mentally active, keeping demantia and loneliness at bay. All in all, while the change in Senior’s LFPR is obvious from the visualization, its reason is manyfolds.\r\nThe second key observation from the chart is the other elephant in the room: the only age group that saw a decline in its LFPR - those aged 25-29 year-old. One plausible reason for this could be an increase in average schooling years of residents aged 25 and over, from 2009’s 9.7 years to 11,2 years in 2019. This is further supported by the increase in proportion of residents who had attained University degree as their highest qualification - from 22.5% in 2009 to 32.4% in 2019. Both these statistics point to the fact that people are increasingly spending more time schooling than working, and hence a reduction in the LFPR.\r\nLastly, let’s discuss the flat plateau for those aged between 30 to 59 which saw the LFPR within the age group increase modestly, ranging from 0.8 percentage point to 6.6 percentage point. From the main viz, it told the factual story that the LFPR for this group of residents did not increase much for the 10 year from 2009 to 2019. However, this is where it is crucial to drill deeper into details and understand the importance of the supporting data table included in the visualization - the actual LFPR (%) for each age group. Based on the table, it is easy to realise that the participation rate for this main bunch of residents were already very high in 2009 to begin with (from 68.4% to 89.3%) - that is, majority of the subpopulation within these age groups were already actively participating in the labour force (i.e. either employed or actively looking for job). As there are bound to be discouraged workers and some form of frictional unemployment that triggers individual to leave the labour force, it is much more difficult to increase the LFPR for age-groups where the rate was already high, especially those nearer to the 100%. In summary, it is not unexpected to see low LFPR percentage change for these age groups with higher LFPR and there is no cause for worry. It would, however, be interesting to see how this figure has changed for the year of 2020 when the unanticipated adverse event in the form of global pandemic hit.\r\nAs a rejoiner, it is thus important to provide clear and informative visualization that are aesthetically pleasing - such observations mentioned in this section would have been difficult to arrive at with the original visualization that lacked clarity in the information presented and key message it is trying to drive at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
